# train-management-system
Hello everyone,

This program is a train management system, made using C++. Users can create an account and choose the city they want to travel to. The available cities are: Islamabad, Hyderabad, Sargodha, Multan, Faisalabad, and Lahore. After deciding this, users also get to choose the food they would like during their journey. All the costs are added and a final ticket is displayed at the end. 

Currently, all the data is being stored using file handling on .txt files, but I am working on integrating an SQL database. This program was made for my OOP semester project. Due to deadlines and other commitments during the semester, I could not give this project the time it deserved and, thus, it does not include all that I had initially planned. Now that the semester is over, I will try to incorporate more of what I had planned, with an SQL database and GUI being my top focus.

Feel free to use this code. I hope you like it and thank you very much.
