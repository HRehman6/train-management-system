# train-management-system
Hello everyone,

This program is a train management system, made using C++. Users get to make an account and choose the city where they want to travel. The available cities are: Islamabad, Hyderabad, Sargodha, Multan, Faisalabad and Lahore. After deciding this, users also get to choose the food they would like during their journey. All the costs are added and a final ticket is displayed at the end. 

Currently, all the data is being stored using file handling on .txt files, but I am working on integrating SQL database so the data will be stored on that. 

Feel free to use this code. I hope you like it and thank you very much.
